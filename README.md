TCS iON RIO-125: Classification Model - Build a Model that Classifies the Side Effects of a Drug

In this study, I explored various classification algorithms to predict drug side effects based on the provided dataset, evaluating each based on classification accuracy. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) stood out, achieving the highest accuracy of 59.03%, showcasing superior predictive capabilities.

While XGBoost performed exceptionally, other models like Linear SVM, Radial SVM, Fine-tuned Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting also displayed promising accuracies ranging from approximately 54.19% to 58.39%, indicating potential for optimization and refinement.

This analysis emphasizes the critical role of algorithm choice in predictive performance. Ongoing efforts involving continuous experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially exploring new algorithms or ensemble methods are crucial for optimal performance.

To enhance predictive capabilities, future steps should encompass comprehensive feature engineering for extracting informative features and a deeper exploration of hyperparameters. These measures could unlock even greater predictive potential.

In conclusion, this project highlights the significance of algorithm selection and the need for continuous refinement. The findings lay the groundwork for advancements in accurately predicting drug side effects, contributing to healthcare improvements and enhanced patient safety.
